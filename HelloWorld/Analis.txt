Array List : 
time spent on adding :  1186190  ns
time spent on search :  28348  ns
time spent on removing :  60116  ns

Linked List : 
time spent on adding :  2915868  ns
time spent on search :  48875  ns
time spent on removing :  86019  ns

Array List adding, removing and search operations are faster compared to the Linked List operations.

Hash Set : 
time spent on adding :  269300  ns
time spent on search :  28837  ns
time spent on removing :  73312  ns

Tree Set : 
time spent on adding :  1055206  ns
time spent on search :  52784  ns
time spent on removing :  63048  ns

Tree Set removing and search operations are faster than the same operations in Hash Set. But adding is slowlier.
